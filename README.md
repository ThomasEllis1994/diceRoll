1: As a DnD dabbler, I want to be able to play online with friends and have a simple website we can use to roll our dice.

2: My girlfriend is always losing our dice. We really like board games, but need to find a workaround for our missing dice. I want a site where I could roll dice for Payday or Monopoly.

3: I like to use a die to randomly choose my workout for the day. I need a website that I could go to on my phone and get my daily workout. I'd love a tracking functionality too.
